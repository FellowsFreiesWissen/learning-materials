In this repository, you can find learning materials for [Open Knowledge Maps](http://openknowledgemaps.org). Our goal is to revolutionize discovery with a visual interface that dramatically increases the visibility of research results for science and society alike. We are  building this interface to the worldâ€™s scientific knowledge as a public good.
